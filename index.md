### Who are we?

Two people that got bored of not having the exact game they wanted to play one day.  
We've also brought some friends along for the ride!

### What are we doing?

Writing and designing a Multiplayer 3D Space Shooter inspired by various things:

Classic Shooters, like [Unreal Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) and [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series))  
Modern class-based shooters like [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) and [Overwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game))  
as well as other space shooters like [EVERSPACE](https://everspace-game.com/), [EVE Valkyrie](https://www.evevalkyrie.com/) and [Microsoft Hellbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbender_(video_game))

### Why are we doing this?

To hone our programming, game design and artistic skills, and to have some fun in the process!

### What engine are we using?

We've built our own! It's called "Polar".  
No need to say it, we think we're insane too.  
If you want to check out the codebase, click [here](https://github.com/polar-engine/polar)

### Can you try the game out yet?

Yes you can!  
It's only a "Tech Demo" at this stage, but you can check out current builds on the [releases](https://github.com/corporeality-space/release/releases) page!  
Check the [blog](/blog) for the latest release notes and updates.

### "Corporeality"?

A play on "Corporeal" in ironic regard to ships being piloted remotely through consciousness transfer, and a portmanteau of "Corporate" and "Reality". We bounced around a few ideas, but we just kept circling back to it, and it stuck!

### This website is really janky! What's up with that?

We only have a vague idea of what we are doing, so this website is as experimental as our game code! <br>

### How can you follow our progress?

There *should* be some buttons up on the top bar for you to click on to take you to various sections of this site with [posts by members of the team](/blog), [information about game design](/design) and [releases](https://github.com/corporeality-space/release/releases)  
The plan is to have a big update each week and sporadic updates from other team members about the code base, art assets and more.
