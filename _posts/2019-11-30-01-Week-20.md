It's that time of the week once again, where we deliver our new and exciting updates on this week's state of Corporeality. Unfortunately, due to me having a busy and also exceptionally distracting week, we didn't get as much done as we were hoping to, but we still have some significant stuff to share with you all.

# Missiles

Thanks to üê∞ The Rabbit, we now have a missile model, along with a bunch of textures to go with it! Take a look at this in-game screenshot of some missiles being fired from the player ship.
