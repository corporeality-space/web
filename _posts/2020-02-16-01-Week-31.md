This week has been spent bug-crushing mainly with not much feature progress.

# What do things look like at the moment?

They look like this!

Not the longest of videos, but you can see that collisions and weapon life timers are now a thing and working rather well.

# Things are looking a bit more Normal

üê∞ The Rabbit has been working hard on the ship model, Normal Mapping is now properly baked in and diffuse textures are currently being worked on.

# What next?

More bugs needing sorted but most of them are nearly resolved.  
Then we need to rework the shader pipeline so it's better optimised.  
We also want to split "primary" and "secondary" weapons into discrete things.  
Doubtless we'll also introduce a load more bugs!

See you all next week!
