description: ...and a Happy New Year!
---

The first week of January is always a busy one, for a variety of reasons.  
So we plan to get back to work seriously on the game next week.

However, for the New Year we thought we'd give you a peek at an actual in-progress build of the game.  
The net-code is disabled but movement and primary weaponry works as well as collisions.  
Bear in mind that this is a very early build, and doesn't represent how later public builds will be in terms of functionality or features, but we hope you'll have fun with it all the same!

You can download the build >> HERE <<



The Corporeality Team wish you all the best for 2020!
