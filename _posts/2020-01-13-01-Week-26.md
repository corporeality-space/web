We are 2 weeks into 2020 and we've already made progress, and had a minor setback.

# The Setback

Let's get the "bad news" out of the way first, shall we?  
During testing on less powerful systems we have encountered an interesting bug that causes mouse input to completely fail if the framerate drops below 25fps.  
Shockk has had a little rant about that on [his Twitter](https://twitter.com/citrusponi/status/1216494721222283266). The technicalities are a bit lost on me, but we believe it can be resolved with a bit of a rework of how we schedule actions in-engine.  
He'll talk about that in more detail in a Tech Blog at some point in the future.

# Progress

Progress has been made in the form of an increase in our social media presence, some updated models provided by The Rabbit as well as a logo to represent us!
