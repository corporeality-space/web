We are 2 weeks into 2020 and we've already made progress, and had a minor setback.

# The Setback

Let's get the "bad news" out of the way first, shall we?  
During testing on less powerful systems we have encountered an interesting bug that causes mouse input to completely fail if the framerate drops below 25fps.  
‚ö° Shockk has had a little rant about that on [his Twitter](https://twitter.com/citrusponi/status/1216494721222283266). The technicalities are a bit lost on me, but we believe it can be resolved with a bit of a rework of how we schedule actions in-engine.  
He'll talk about that in more detail in a Tech Blog at some point in the future.

# Progress

Progress has been made in the form of an increase in our social media presence, some updated models provided by üê∞ The Rabbit as well as a logo to represent us!

The textures have been totally reworked and previously unseen issues with normal mapping have been resolved.  
The Ship will also be getting this refresh in the near future.  
As you can see she's also designed us a wonderfully minimalist logo for us, we'll be rolling that on all platforms this week.

## All a-Twitter

Yes, we are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/corporealitydev) now so you can follow us there to see when blogs go up, ask us questions about development or provide feedback about releases on the site.

## Steam Powered

I'm hoping to have the Steam Store page up soon, we just need more art assets and some more descriptive stuff. There's quite a lot involved in getting a listing on Steam actually published, but we're nearly there!

See you all next week!
