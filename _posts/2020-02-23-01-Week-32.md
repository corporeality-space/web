We've both had an incredibly busy week this week. So we've not got a lot of work done.  
However we got some work done over the weekend and have a test build up and ready for you to check out!

# Gimme Gimme!

Just hit the "[Releases](https://github.com/corporeality-space/release/releases)" button in the top right and you'll be taken to a page with the latest releases on it. As of this post, that should be Technical Preview 2 (v0.0.2).

# Can I play with the console?

Yes! Our engine has a rudimentary debug console that exposes limited engine functionality, with more features being added on a regular basis. Most of this won't be useful to you as a playtester but here are a couple of things that may prove useful or interesting.

```
system.renderer.fullscreen = 1
system.renderer.debugdraw  = 1
component.scale.z          = 5
engine.quit
```

# Changed Stuff

- Added missile flight time (2 seconds until death)
- Missiles now die on contact with asteroids
- Many renderer optimizations and general performance improvements
- Fixed mouse not working at framerates below 25 FPS
- Fixed subtle timing issues from frame to frame
- Fixed audio bugs (audio still disabled for now)
- Improved engine logging output (timestamps and categories now!)

# Broken Stuff!

This is still early days and we have a few bugs that we know about so far:  

- Master Server not Online (No Public Multiplayer)
- Reaching 0 health does not destroy ship
- Collisions are very basic (Spheres for days)
- Sounds work, but are disabled

If you have any other issues though, please reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CorporealityDev), we greatly appreciate it!

See you all next week!
