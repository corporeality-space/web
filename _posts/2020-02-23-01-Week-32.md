We've both had an incredibly busy week this week. So we've not got a lot of work done.  
However we got some work done over the weekend and have a test build up and ready for you to check out!

# Stuff's Broken!

This is still early days and we have a few bugs that we know about so far:  

- Master Server not Online (No Public Multiplayer)
- Reaching 0 health does not destroy ship
- Collisions are very basic (Spheres for days)
- In some cases the game can crash when firing the main weapon
- Sounds work, but are disabled

If you have any other issues though, please reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CorporealityDev), we greatly appreciate it!

See you all next week!
